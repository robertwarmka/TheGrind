## Snippets

```
## Some sprint some crawl
An interaction is called crawl, the name shall reflect the pain inherent to the struggle.
```

```
## Grinding 
Agile sounds nice but to get an astonishing diamond you need to polish/grind the raw ball of mud that you start with!
```

```
## The Holy Requirement

The customer will create requirements, and one of the steps of the grind is to fulfill those
requirements. The best way to track the project progress is the magical tool of spreadsheets, your
project manager's best friend. The more checkboxes of the spreadsheet that your project manager can
check off and create project progress reports for, the better.

As a matter of fact, one of the core responsibilites of the project manager is to break down
requirements into as many pieces as possible so that there are more requirements to fulfill. For the
true Grinder, the checking off of spreadsheet requirements is one of the core deliverables to the
customer, so the more requirements that can be created, the more satisfied the customer will be, and
the more successful the project is.
