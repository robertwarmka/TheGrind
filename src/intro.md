# Intro

In 2001, 17 software developers came together in Snowbird, Utah to propose a new way of developing software "by doing it and helping others do it." With their twelve principles to guide and influence the path of the software developer, they have ushered us into a new era of software development and people management.
Here, in the great year of 2019, two software developers came together in Munich, Germany to join together as the spokespeople for the successor and evolution of Agile: The Grind

The Grind captures the original spirit of the Agile manifesto, and evolves it to match the reality of what executing a process development and methodology strategy in a company truly entails.


# Priciples Behind The Grind Manifesto

The task has been given unto us to take and adapt the original Agile Manifesto to reflect the modern realities and implementations of process development at modern companies.

1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous marking off of valuable spreadsheet deadline checkboxes.
2. Welcome changing project direction, even late in development. Grind processes harness direction change for the customer's competitive confusion.
3. Deliver complicated software infrequently, on a timescale of once every couple of weeks to once every couple of months, with a preference to the longer timescale.
4. Business people and developers must tell the other daily how to do their jobs throughout the project.
5. Build individuals around expensive projects. Give them the environment and support they need to drag the project out for as long as possible, and trust them to never get the job done.
6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is via cryptic development tickets and passive-aggressive messages.
7. Further project delays are the primary measures of progress.
8. Grind processes promote sustainable stress. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain constant heightened cortisol levels indefinitely.
9. Continuous attention to technical abstractions and methodology before reason enhances grindability.
10. Abstraction--the art of maximizing the amount of work done--is essential.
11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs are created upfront from silo-organized departments.
12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more splintered, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordinly.
