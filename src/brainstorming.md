# Brainstorming


## Some sprint some crawl
A interation is called crawl, the name shall reflect the pain an inherit struggle.

## Grinding 
Agile sounds nice but to get a astonishing diamond one needs to polish/grind the raw one!

## Test last
only write tests which just cover lines of code and prove nothing, also very important only
do this once all code is written -> write tests which prove the current state is working (no other result is accaptele)
Only write tests to pacify processes and managements sheets and charts never write tests
to improve maintainability or product quality.

 -> Reasoning: Tests first is overall more efficient, but we want to waste moeny and resources without
               contirbuting/delivering a good prodcut.
